## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ We are an organization of researchers, educators and citizens interested in North American pikas (Ochotona princeps and O. collaris). Our efforts focus on understanding pika ecology through research, monitoring, outreach and collaboration. The North American Pika Consortium (NAPC) was formed in 2010 as part of the 1st North American Pika Conference, hosted by Teton Science Schools in Jackson, Wyoming.
